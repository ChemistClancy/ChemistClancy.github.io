                                            July 2025
                                            <p>One of our current materials of interest is 2D borophene oxide, which is a high conductivity metallic 2D material with interesting surface chemistry. Think MXenes, but without requiring HF solutions to etch out from MAX phases (in fact, making it is as easy as dissolving KBH4 in MeCN and letting it sit for a week as the crystals grow). This great new material was discovered ~5 years ago by Prof Tetsuya Kambe, then of Tokyo Tech, and now a professor at Osaka University. We had the great pleasure of having Prof Kambe come to visit to see our labs, give a seminar to UCL (and Imperial College London later as part of the LCN Highlight Seminars Series), as we build a new and promising collaboration.

                                            July 2025
                                            <p>Seriously, ten years! This was my first ever discovery and is still a staple of groups worldwide. Its simple as anything: stir sodium metal and naphthalene in dimethylacetamide (aka the world’s greatest solvent), and you get a green liquid capable of dissolving nanotubes. The only thing that can compete is superacids which, well, aren’t fun to work with - although now we do that too. The trick is that the highly reducing naphthalide will usually destroy solvents which dissolve reduced nanocarbons (DMF, DMSO, NMP, etc). For DMF, this occurs through the naphthalide (or sodium metal if not converted yet) attacking the formic proton leading to NaC(O)NMe<sub>2</sub> formation, which then loses CO to give NaNMe<sub>2</sub>, which catalytically attacks other DMF molecules. It all becomes yellow goop. So I wondered would would happen if I undercut that first step by swapping out that formic proton for a methyl, and bish bash bosh, you have a solution stable for about 2 days. By now its probably not my most important, famous, or interesting discovery, but it is the first that was ever unequivocally mine and I love it. So here’s to you DMAc - Happy Birthday.

                                            July 2025
                                            <p>Nanotubide (anionic nanotubes) are a longstanding focus in my scientific career, and after a post-PhD hiatus as I built an independent portfolio, they finally came back into the fold this year in our <i><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-01865-9", target="_blank">Nature Nanotechnology</a></i> paper, and just like London buses, along comes another. This time, the work was led by my long-time friend <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wjleedku/", target="_blank">Wonjun Lee</a>, who has <i>finally</i> unambiguously shown that nanotubide can form lyotropic liquid crystals (without crown ethers), using the DMAc/sodium/naphthalene reaction we invented. After a bit of proper fundamentals to understand how the sodium counterion concentration dictated the effective width (and thus effective aspect ratio) of the liquid crystals, they started fiber spinning. With a focus on the oft-ignored torsion properties, they break our previous record in specific torsional strength to make highly conductive tough fibers suitable for wearable electronics, like a powerglove-esque motion detector.

                                            June 2025
                                            <p>Printable aluminium metal would revolutionise electronics, but most soluble aluminium compounds transform into aluminium oxide which can be useful (e.g. see our printable Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> work in <a href="https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cplu.202200411", target="_blank">ChemPlusChem</a>) but it doesn't exactly conduct. Most Al-metal precursors rely on hydride clusters which are effective, but degrade at annoyingly low temperatures and have a nasty habit of setting everything on fire, making them less practical for the real world. Here the clever folks in Caroline Knapp's group made sterically-constrained Al<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>N<sub>3</sub> clusters which can degrade to metallic Al, but also just fizzle out in air, making for a much safer alternative.

While we don’t expect to find a PiFM user, we will be prioritising candidates with probe microscopy experience, ideally for mechanically exfoliated 2D nanomaterials.

                                             <p>As a research group interested in nanomaterials, solution processing, and neutron scattering, it feels  good to combine all three and use neutrons to uncover how nanomaterial solutions form. Spoiler warning for the <i>Nature Nanotechnology</i> paper, but it is due to long range ordering of solvent molecules. While each solvent-solvent interaction is weak, by templating the majority of the molecules in solution without significantly disrupting the inter-solvent bonding motifs, you can have a notable enthalpic gain for minimal entropic cost upon solvation. We can also see how sodium counterions behave next to charged carbon nanosurfaces and see they are desolvated when close due to preferential solvation of the surface, with really significant implications for the supercapacitor community.

There is an added benefit that starch nanofiber mats have remarkable promise in next generation medical applications from smart wound dressings, to bone regeneration scaffolds, and with this work we can now make them in a more environmentally friendly route. The trick is to not undertake industrial starch purification, and instead use (starch-rich) flour from Marks &amp; Spencers. It caught the eye of the public and we are in The Telegraph, The i, Irish Times, The Moncrieff Show, New Scientist, and beyond! Most credit and acclaim should go to Beatrice, who did the vast majority of the work as her MSci project.

                                            <p>Phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) are remarkably promising materials, and with the pioneering work of Prof Howard in UCL Physics, we now have a route to make them in bulk through a two-step process: intercalation in lithium electride, then dissolution in amides. However, while it works, we don’t know how or why, which impedes our ability to control and improve the synthesis. To this end, we have decoupled the steps to see if PNRs are formed through intercalation alone, taking inspiration from <a href=" https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12411", target="_blank">the Hirsh group of Erlangen, who deintercalated graphite intercalation compounds with PhCN</a>. Long story short, it looks like the intercalation of black phosphorus primes it for ribbonisation, but the solvent is needed to create the ribbons, not just to dissolve them. Now we just need to find out <i>how</i> the solvent does this.

As with all disordered liquids, finding the structure that is there is hard, which is why we employ neutron scattering techniques and isotopic substitution to find the signal in the noise. We actually go one step beyond here, being the first people to use a new routine, Dissolve, which uses both Monte Carlo simulations and molecular dynamics to untangle the neutron data. We fully expect it to become the gold standard for liquid structure neutron data analysis moving forward so are delighted to have pipped several other groups to the post! The use of a single component rigid molecule certainly helped versus some of the more complex systems we and others study, but don’t let the molecular simplicity trick you into thinking the liquid structure is simple.

PTI carbon nitrides have pyridine N's and NH bridges which can be protonated/deprotonated respectively. After acid/base treatment, the charge on the sheets makes them soluble in water spontaneously, but only up to a certain point. If you add too much acid/base, the charge gets screened and they are no longer soluble.

Here, the interactions between benzene and methanol have been derived which not only show O-H to pi bonding above/below the ring, but also weak hydrogen bonds between benzene's C-H and methanol's oxygen. The ordered belt it forms around the benzene circumference is surprising  - given the weak bonding involved - but can be seen to come from taking advantage of the subtle shift in electrons from the aforementioned OH-pi bonds!

Field effect transistors and space charge limited current devices are assembled to probe their electronic properties, and the weird magnetic edges we see in PNRs (under review in somewhere more exciting than even JACS!) are also present.

                                            <p>Phosphorene materials are a growing trend in the <i>Clancy Lab</i> and our most recent work looks at single layer sheets with diameters tens of nanometers wide. Previously, these phosphorene quantum dots (PQDs) were made from expensive black phosphorus, but by taking red phosphorus - the cheap stuff found on match heads - bashing it with steel balls at high speed, we make PQDs bound together into a big block. A good start, but not usable yet. The trick then is to use lithium to free up the PQDs to give soluble nanomaterials. As a small aside, we also became the first ever researchers to take atomic resolution microscopy images of a 2D material in solution (see below)!

                                            June 2023
                                            <p>The PQD research (see above) included the first ever liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LP-TEM) of a 2D nanomaterial in solution. Getting TEM images of anything in liquids is challenging as the beam must go through 2 windows and the noisy liquid, and so atomically thin 2D nanomaterials had previously been thought near-impossible. However, in collaboration with our resident TEM expert, Dr Andy Stewart, we broke through this barrier by taking advantage of the cutting edge prototype <i>Nano Channel</i> system developed by Danish company <i>Insight Chips</i> and advanced denoising software.

Jakub gets most of the credit for the blue-skies research plan which will remain secret for now in case either (a) it works and we want to publish it, or (b) it utterly fails and we want to pretend it didn't happen. We will say it will involve a welcome, belated return to the world of SWCNT research.</p><br>

Secondly, it will be funding an upcoming PDRA position (for 2 years in the first instance), on developing new functionalisation reactions of nanomaterials.
